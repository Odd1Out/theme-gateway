Plug-in theme for Micro.blog that includes a link to other platforms on the home page. Also supports microblog posts and full blog posts. Design is based on simple.css with customizations.

Most of the fields are simple usernames. For Mastodon, there are 2 parts: username can be in the form `you@mastodon.social` and the URL can be `https://mastodon.social/@you`.

For the blog URL, if this site _is_ your blog, enter a URL with a path to take the user to see a full post list, like `https://example.com/archive` or `https://example.com/2022`.
